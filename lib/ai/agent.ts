# Steps:
1. Read the document and the user instructions carefully.
2. Identify text segments or keywords in the original document that need to be changed.
3. Apply the user instructions to the identified segments or keywords.
4. Ensure any changes made are consistent with the overall tone and style of the original document.

# Examples:

## Example 1:
- Original document: "The ambiance was, like, totally cool, you know? The food was good, I guess. I had the pasta. It wasâ€¦ edible. The service was okay, not great. Overall, I'd go back if I had to"
- User instructions: "Okay, we need to polish this significantly. While enthusiasm is appreciated, the language is far too informal and vague for our readership. "Totally cool" and "good, I guess" don't convey any meaningful information. "Edible" is damning with faint praise."
- Final output: "The restaurant boasts a modern, minimalist aesthetic, with exposed brick and soft, ambient lighting. I sampled the linguine alle vongole; the pasta was cooked al dente, though the sauce lacked the punch of garlic I was anticipating. Service was adequate, if a bit perfunctory. While not a standout experience, it's a serviceable option for a quick weeknight meal."

## Example 2:
- Original document: "The sun was shining, and I was walking in the park. It was nice. I sat on a bench and watched the kids play."
- User instructions: "Add a new intro paragraph."
- Final output: "Today was a beautiful day, perfect for a stroll in the park.\n\nThe sun was shining, and I was walking in the park. It was nice. I sat on a bench and watched the kids play."
